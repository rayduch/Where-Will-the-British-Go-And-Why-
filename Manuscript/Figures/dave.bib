  abstract = {For people with managerial, professional or technical skills and work experience, the job market is global, if they so choose. Their skills and work experience are sought after in a number of countries and they have a choice of where they would prefer to work. This article1 examines globally mobile skilled migrants' reasons for migration and return migration, as indicated in Australian research, and the policy challenges some of these reasons may pose for source and destination countries that want to retain or attract these people. This is because while some reasons or factors motivating the migration or return migration of skilled workers can be influenced by government policy, others such as lifestyle or quality of life factors may pose more difficulties for policy influence.},

  abstract = {Combining unique, annual, bilateral data on labor flows of highly skilled immigrants for 10 OECD destinations between 2000 and 2012, with new databases comprising both unilateral and bilateral policy instruments, we present the first judicious cross-country assessment of policies aimed to attract and select high-skilled workers. Points-based systems are much more effective in attracting and selecting high-skilled migrants than requiring a job offer, labor market tests, and shortage lists. Offers of permanent residency, while attracting the highly skilled, overall reduce the human capital content of labor flows because they prove more attractive to non-high-skilled workers. Bilateral recognition of diploma and social security agreements foster greater flows of high-skilled workers and improve the skill selectivity of immigrant flows. Conversely, double taxation agreements deter high-skilled migrants, although they do not alter overall skill selectivity. Our results are robust to a variety of empirical specifications that account for destination-specific amenities, multilateral resistance to migration, and the endogeneity of immigration policies.},

  volume = {51},
  issn = {0197-9183},
  doi = {10.1111/imre.12261},
  abstract = {The effectiveness of migration policies has been widely contested. However, because of methodological and conceptual limitations, evidence has remained inconclusive. Moreover, prior studies focus on the effects of policies on inflows and fail to assess the simultaneous effect of policies on outflows. This is essential from a theoretical point of view as immigration restrictions may reduce both inflows and outflows and, hence, overall circulation. This renders the effect of immigration restrictions on net migration theoretically ambiguous. To fill this gap, and using unique migration and visa data from the Determinants of International Migration (DEMIG) project, this paper assesses the short- and long-term effects of travel visa policy regimes on bilateral immigration and emigration dynamics. The results suggest that travel visa policies significantly decrease inflows, but this effect is undermined by decreasing outflows of the same migrant groups. This confirms that migration restrictions decrease circulation and tend to encourage long-term settlement, and thereby sharply reduce the responsiveness of migration to economic fluctuations in destination and origin societies. We also identify asymmetric policy effects with migration flows declining only very gradually after a visa introduction but increasing almost immediately after visa removal.},

Data come from six rounds of the European Social Survey between 2002 and 2012. Using multi-level models with applications for repeated cross-sectional data, the study examines the implications of changes tied to the political advancements of the radical right with a focus on three possible scenarios: people's attitudes about immigration have generally become more negative, opposition towards immigration has become more dependent on immigrants' ethnicity, and attitudes towards immigration have become more polarised. Contrary to expectations, it is found that neither the presence, the representational strength, nor the nationalistic framing of an RRP affect opposition towards immigration over time. Thus, the conclusion is that the RRPs, so far, have not driven anti-immigration attitudes in Europe. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in the concluding section.},

Theorists argue that individual reputations can provide an important means for solving repeated versions of that public goods game. Numerous experimental findings also show that preplay communication leads to higher rates of contributions to public goods. The authors investigate whether preplay communication and reputational information aid in solving collective actions problems by using laboratory experimental methods to disentangle the separate effects of both signals and past behavioral information. The results are discouraging. Increased information about the past behavior of subjects, coupled with preplay signaling, decreases levels of contributions to the public good. These results point to how quickly group distrust takes root and the consequences of that distrust. }

In all models, after controlling for economic fundamentals, the hypothesis that consumer sentiment does not cause GNP (in the Granger sense) can be rejected. Variance decompositions suggest that consumer sentiment accounts for between 13 and 26 percent of the innovation variance of GNP.}}

abstract="This paper builds upon the renowned media reports-based ``Economic policy uncertainty'' (EPU) index and analyzes its Granger-causal interrelationships with consumer confidence and aggregate economic activity. Employing a heterogeneous panel Granger causality test on data from 13 world countries, the authors find that: (1) the analyzed countries are quite heterogeneous in terms of the found causality patterns; (2) the EPU index does not Granger-cause the overall economic activity in the vast majority of the analyzed economies; (3) consumer confidence is confirmed as a significant predictor of aggregate output in all countries; (4) news media uncertainty and consumer confidence largely represent two distinct psychological transmission channels. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that consumer confidence (i.e. first moment, expectation) is considerably more important for the aggregate economic activity than economic uncertainty (i.e. second moment, variance). Two robustness checks are provided (an alternative lag structure of the Granger causality test, and the usage of monthly (industrial production) instead of quarterly (GDP) economic activity data). The obtained inferences are quite robust to both model alternations. Additionally, the leading characteristics of EPU index are found to be less pronounced than those of GARCH uncertainty and forecast disagreement.",

We find that bundling tends to increase political accountability when the complexities of bundled policy areas are sufficiently symmetric and decrease it when the complexities are sufficiently asymmetric. When bundling is beneficial, its advantage comes from the possibility of sustaining in equilibrium a mechanism that makes greater investment into policy in multiple issue areas a form of insurance purchase for the officeholder. The appeal of such insurance purchases and the edge they give to bundling persist in the presence of the possibility of policy capture by special interests, upending the conventional wisdom. }}

abstract = {Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online crowdsourcing service where anonymous online workers complete web-based tasks for small sums of money. The service has attracted attention from experimental psychologists interested in gathering human subject data more efficiently. However, relative to traditional laboratory studies, many aspects of the testing environment are not under the experimenter's control. In this paper, we attempt to empirically evaluate the fidelity of the AMT system for use in cognitive behavioral experiments. These types of experiment differ from simple surveys in that they require multiple trials, sustained attention from participants, comprehension of complex instructions, and millisecond accuracy for response recording and stimulus presentation. We replicate a diverse body of tasks from experimental psychology including the Stroop, Switching, Flanker, Simon, Posner Cuing, attentional blink, subliminal priming, and category learning tasks using participants recruited using AMT. While most of replications were qualitatively successful and validated the approach of collecting data anonymously online using a web-browser, others revealed disparity between laboratory results and online results. A number of important lessons were encountered in the process of conducting these replications that should be of value to other researchers.},

The central purpose of this article is to demonstrate how to use this Web site for conducting behavioral research and to lower the barrier to entry for researchers who could benefit from this platform. We describe general techniques that apply to a variety of types of research and experiments across disciplines. We begin by discussing some of the advantages of doing experiments on Mechanical Turk, such as easy access to a large, stable, and diverse subject pool, the low cost of doing experiments, and faster iteration between developing theory and executing experiments. While other methods of conducting behavioral research may be comparable to or even better than Mechanical Turk on one or more of the axes outlined above, we will show that when taken as a whole Mechanical Turk can be a useful tool for many researchers. We will discuss how the behavior of workers compares with that of experts and laboratory subjects. Then we will illustrate the mechanics of putting a task on Mechanical Turk, including recruiting subjects, executing the task, and reviewing the work that was submitted. We also provide solutions to common problems that a researcher might face when executing their research on this platform, including techniques for conducting synchronous experiments, methods for ensuring high-quality work, how to keep data private, and how to maintain code security.},

abstract = {Why do people help strangers when there is a low probability that help will be directly reciprocated or socially rewarded? A possible explanation is that these acts are contagious: those who receive or observe help from a stranger become more likely to help others. We test two mechanisms for the social contagion of generosity among strangers: generalized reciprocity (a recipient of generosity is more likely to pay it forward) and third-party influence (an observer of generous behavior is more likely to emulate it). We use an online experiment with randomized trials to test the two hypothesized mechanisms and their interaction by manipulating the extent to which participants receive and observe help. Results show that receiving help can increase the willingness to be generous towards others, but observing help can have the opposite effect, especially among those who have not received help. These results suggest that observing widespread generosity may attenuate the belief that one's own efforts are needed.},

Yet while economists have long emphasized the importance of government quality, historically they have paid less attention to the internal workings of the state and the individuals who provide the public services. This paper reviews a nascent but growing body of field experiments that explores the personnel economics of the state. To place the experimental findings in context, we begin by documenting some stylized facts about how public sector employment differs from that in the private sector. In particular, we show that in most countries throughout the world, public sector employees enjoy a significant wage premium over their private sector counterparts. Moreover, this wage gap is largest among low-income countries, which tends to be precisely where governance issues are most severe. These differences in pay, together with significant information asymmetries within government organizations in low-income countries, provide a prima facie rationale for the emphasis of the recent field experiments on three aspects of the state?employee relationship: selection, incentive structures, and monitoring. We review the findings on all three dimensions and then conclude this survey with directions for future research.},

Three formats were investigated: relative risk reductions, absolute risk reductions, and number needed to treat or screen. Methods. A systematic review of the published literature was conducted. Articles were retrieved by searching a variety of databases and screened for inclusion by 2 reviewers. Data were extracted on characteristics of the subjects and methodologies used. Log-odds ratios were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results. A total of 24 articles were retrieved that reported on 31 unique experiments. The meta-analysis showed that treatments were evaluated more favorably when the relative risk format was used rather than the absolute risk or number needed to treat format. However, a significant amount of heterogeneity was found between studies, the sources of which were explored using subgroup analyses and metaregression. Although the subgroup analyses revealed smaller effect sizes in the studies conducted on physicians, the metaregression showed that these differences were largely accounted for by other features of the study design. Most notably, variations in effect sizes were explained by the particular wordings that the studies had chosen to use for the relative risk and absolute risk reductions. Conclusions. The published literature has consistently demonstrated that relative risk formats produce more favorable evaluations of treatments than absolute risk or number needed to treat formats. However, the effects are heterogeneous and seem to be moderated by key differences between the methodologies used. }

For both lung cancer mortality risks and total smoking mortality risks, respondents believe that e-cigarettes pose risks that are lower than the risks of conventional tobacco cigarettes. However, people greatly overestimate the risk levels of e-cigarettes compared with the actual risk levels. Risk beliefs for conventional cigarettes receive at least a two-thirds informational weight in the formation of e-cigarette risk beliefs. Public perceptions of nicotine levels of e-cigarettes are closer to the beliefs for conventional cigarettes than are their health risk perceptions. Consumers'?? desired uses of e-cigarettes are more strongly related to health risk perceptions than perceived e-cigarette nicotine levels. The overestimation of e-cigarette risks establishes a potential role for informational policies. }

 abstract = {RCTs would be more useful if there were more realistic expectations of them and if their pitfalls were better recognized. For example, and contrary to many claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything but the treatment across treatments and controls, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) confounders. Estimates apply to the trial sample only, sometimes a convenience sample, and usually selected; justification is required to extend them to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs. Demanding ?external validity? is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its contribution. Statistical inference on ATEs involves hazards that are not always recognized. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon and not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ?what works,? but ?why things work?. },

ABSTRACT={Although lying (bear false witness) is explicitly prohibited in the Decalogue and a focus of interest in philosophy and theology, more recently the behavioral and neural mechanisms of deception are gaining increasing attention from diverse fields especially economics, psychology and neuroscience. Despite the considerable role of heredity in explaining individual differences in deceptive behavior, few studies have investigated which specific genes contribute to the heterogeneity of lying behavior across individuals. Also, little is known concerning which specific neurotransmitter pathways underlie deception. Towards addressing these two key questions, we implemented a neurogenetic strategy and modeled deception by an incentivized die-under-cup task in a laboratory setting. The results of this exploratory study provide provisional evidence that SNP variants across the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) gene, that encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of brain serotonin, contribute to individual differences in deceptive behavior.}

abstract="Online labor markets provide new opportunities for behavioral research, but conducting economic experiments online raises important methodological challenges. This particularly holds for interactive designs. In this paper, we provide a methodological discussion of the similarities and differences between interactive experiments conducted in the laboratory and online. To this end, we conduct a repeated public goods experiment with and without punishment using samples from the laboratory and the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. We chose to replicate this experiment because it is long and logistically complex. It therefore provides a good case study for discussing the methodological and practical challenges of online interactive experimentation. We find that basic behavioral patterns of cooperation and punishment in the laboratory are replicable online. The most important challenge of online interactive experiments is participant dropout. We discuss measures for reducing dropout and show that, for our case study, dropouts are exogenous to the experiment. We conclude that data quality for interactive experiments via the Internet is adequate and reliable, making online interactive experimentation a potentially valuable complement to laboratory studies.",

In addition to a baseline treatment, in which subjects rolled a die in private and showed a high extent of dishonest behavior, we increased the degree of social control by a novel treatment in which subjects played in randomly assigned pairs of two. The presence of others proved to substantially, but only temporarily reduce dishonest behavior. Furthermore, one treatment group received feedback on unethical behavior of participants in a similar experiment. Knowing that others betrayed in the experiment facilitated social learning and led to a higher prevalence of cheating. Finally, increasing the degree of anonymity by re-running the experiment online increased the extent of norm transgressions slightly. "

In both variants of the game, cheating is invisible because subjects make their choices purely in their minds.

The order of play has a significant impact on cheating behavior, even though the rules cannot be enforced. "

Method 13,324 adult (??? 18 years) cigarette smokers from the USA, Canada, UK, and Australia from one of the first three waves (2002???2004) of the International Tobacco Control 4-Country survey were employed for the predictive analysis where beliefs measured in one wave (1???3) of a cohort were used to predict cessation outcomes in the next wave (2???4). Results Both types of belief were negatively associated with both intention to quit in the same wave and making a quit attempt at the next wave. When taken together and controlling for demographic factors, the risk-minimizing beliefs continued to be predictive, but the self-exempting belief was not. Some of the effects of risk-minimizing beliefs on quit attempts seem to be independent of intentions, but not consistently independent of other known predictors. There were no consistent predictive effects on sustained cessation among those who made attempts to quit for either measure. Conclusions Countering risk-minimizing beliefs may facilitate increased quitting, but this may not be so important for self-exempting beliefs. "

abstract ={Risk communications are frequently intended to help people understand hazards they face, 
with the hope that this understanding will help them make better decisions about the need for 
action or help them choose among alternative actions. To evaluate the success of such 
communications, a definition of ``understanding'' is needed. This paper suggests 
that decisions about personal risks require, at a minimum, information about the nature and 
likelihood of potential ill effects, information about the risk factors that modify one's 
susceptibility, and information about the ease or difficulty of avoiding harm. Even if these 
attributes are accepted as essential criteria for understanding, research on risk perceptions 
suggests that assessing what people know or believe is sometimes quite difficult. The focus of the 
paper is on the several dimensions of risk comprehension. Examples of how each can be assessed 
are drawn from research on public perceptions of the risks from smoking. These examples 
demonstrate that the public has only a limited understanding of smoking risks.},

When respondents were asked what illnesses are caused by smoking, lung cancer was the only illness that could be identified by a clear majority of respondents. Roughly half mentioned emphysema. A much smaller percentage of respondents were able to mention any cardiovascular disease or any kind of cancer other than lung cancer. People also underestimated the death rate from lung cancer and overestimated survival duration. Only a minority realized that emphysema is incurable. Large portions of the sample said they knew only a little about the pain and suffering experienced by individuals with these illnesses. The results demonstrated that even though people recognize that smoking can lead to adverse health consequences, they do not have even a basic understanding of the nature and severity of these consequences.},

In particular, we ask if decision makers are blamed for being pivotal if they implement an unpopular outcome in a sequential voting process. We conduct an experimental voting game in which decision makers vote about the allocation of money between themselves and recipients without voting rights. We measure responsibility attributions for voting decisions by eliciting the monetary punishment that recipients assign to individual decision makers. We find that pivotal decision makers are punished significantly more for an unpopular voting outcome than non-pivotal decision makers. Our data also suggest that some voters avoid being pivotal by voting strategically in order to delegate the pivotal vote to subsequent decision makers. "

abstract="The aim of the paper is to explore and assess the process of responsibility, decoupling point, and disengagement of moral responsibility, in combination with business sustainability (BSus) in supply chains. The research is based on a qualitative approach consisting of two multifaceted case studies, each including multiple case companies and different empirical research characteristics, and a review of BSus in supply chain literature. The case studies apply moral disengagement (MDis) to propose how moral responsibility can deteriorate in supply chains, and the literature review identifies elements of BSus in supply chain management (SCM). The contribution of this paper is to compare these two research streams and evaluate the efficacy of the concepts proposed in the case studies. Through this study, BSus gains an entirely different and complementary toolkit which should facilitate further and more effective research in SCM. The theory of MDis also provides a foundation for reinforcing explanatory and prescriptive aspects of `best practices' in the SCM literature. The findings also establish a basis for organizing and monitoring supply chains so as to improve BSus efforts. Considering moral responsibility as a flow this research explains why and how certain practices may impede BSus efforts in supply chains. Original and/or innovative outcomes include explanatory and prescriptive insights that emerge from a combination of empirical findings from two case studies, including seven companies and a framework for improving BSus management in supply chains, based on a typology of moral disengagement.",

We find that if taxpayers' incomes are correlated (e.g., when they are subject to a common shock) the optimal audit probability for low declarations is an increasing function of the average declaration, as the latter is an informative signal of the realized level of income. Since a taxpayer's optimal declaration is an increasing function of the probability of an audit, the optimal auditing rule creates incentives for taxpayers to coordinate their declarations. The resulting coordination game features multiplicity of equilibria and thus ???strategic uncertainty??? about the equilibrium that will be selected.},

abstract ={Survey experiments, like vignette and conjoint analyses, are widely used in the social sciences to elicit stated preferences and study how humans make multidimensional choices. However, there is a paucity of research on the external validity of these methods that examines whether the determinants that explain hypothetical choices made by survey respondents match the determinants that explain what subjects actually do when making similar choices in real-world situations. This study compares results from conjoint and vignette analyses on which immigrant attributes generate support for naturalization with closely corresponding behavioral data from a natural experiment in Switzerland, where some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship applications of foreign residents. Using a representative sample from the same population and the official descriptions of applicant characteristics that voters received before each referendum as a behavioral benchmark, we find that the effects of the applicant attributes estimated from the survey experiments perform remarkably well in recovering the effects of the same attributes in the behavioral benchmark. We also find important differences in the relative performances of the different designs. Overall, the paired conjoint design, where respondents evaluate two immigrants side by side, comes closest to the behavioral benchmark; on average, its estimates are within 2\% percentage points of the effects in the behavioral benchmark.}}

Customers in a restaurant in tables of one or two diners who paid with cash received excessive change of either 10 or 40 Shekels (about \$3 or \$12). A majority of customers (128 out of 192) did not return the excessive change. Repeated customers returned the excessive change much more often than one-time customers. Women returned the extra change much more often than men, especially among repeated customers. Interestingly, a table with a woman and a man behaves similarly to one or two males and not to a female table. Surprisingly, tables with two diners were not significantly more likely to return the excessive change. Customers receiving 10 extra Shekels were much less likely to return them than those who received 40 extra Shekels, but it is hard to know to what extent this comes from intentional behavior versus lower likelihood to observe the extra change when it is lower. We also found evidence for variation in dishonesty as a function of the time during the day. "

	abstract = {A vast literature demonstrates that voters around the world who benefit from their governments{\textquoteright} discretionary spending cast ballots for the incumbent party in larger proportions than those not receiving funds. But surprisingly, and contrary to most theories of political accountability, the evidence seems to indicate that voters also reward incumbent parties for implementing {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}programmatic{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} spending legislation, passed with support from all major parties, and over which incumbents have no discretion. Why voters would attribute responsibility when none exists is unclear, as is why minority party legislators would approve of legislation that will cost them votes. We address this puzzle with one of the largest randomized social experiments ever, resulting in clear rejection of the claim that programmatic policies greatly increase voter support for incumbents. We also reanalyze the study cited as claiming the strongest support for the electoral effects of programmatic policies, which is also a very large scale randomized experiment. We show that its key results vanish after correcting either a simple coding error affecting only two observations or highly unconventional data analysis procedures (or both). We also discuss how these consistent empirical results from the only two probative experiments on this question may be reconciled with several observational and theoretical studies touching on similar questions in other contexts.},

We use the gap between household expenditures and reported earnings as a proxy for tax evasion with data from a household panel for 1998???2004. We associate large and significant changes in tax evasion following the flat tax reform with changes in voluntary compliance. We develop a consumption?based framework to assess the deadweight loss from income tax in the presence of tax evasion and show that the efficiency gains from the reform are at least 30 percent smaller than the gains implied by conventional approaches.},

    abstract = {<p>This paper specifies, designs and critically evaluates two tools for the automated identification of demographic data (age, occupation and social class) from the profile descriptions of Twitter users in the United Kingdom (UK). Meta-data data routinely collected through the Collaborative Social Media Observatory (COSMOS: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cosmosproject.net/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cosmosproject.net/</ext-link>) relating to UK Twitter users is matched with the occupational lookup tables between job and social class provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) using SOC2010. Using expert human validation, the validity and reliability of the automated matching process is critically assessed and a prospective class distribution of UK Twitter users is offered with 2011 Census baseline comparisons. The pattern matching rules for identifying age are explained and enacted following a discussion on how to minimise false positives. The age distribution of Twitter users, as identified using the tool, is presented alongside the age distribution of the UK population from the 2011 Census. The automated occupation detection tool reliably identifies certain occupational groups, such as professionals, for which job titles cannot be confused with hobbies or are used in common parlance within alternative contexts. An alternative explanation on the prevalence of hobbies is that the creative sector is overrepresented on Twitter compared to 2011 Census data. The age detection tool illustrates the youthfulness of Twitter users compared to the general UK population as of the 2011 Census according to proportions, but projections demonstrate that there is still potentially a large number of older platform users. It is possible to detect ``signatures'' of both occupation and age from Twitter meta-data with varying degrees of accuracy (particularly dependent on occupational groups) but further confirmatory work is needed.</p>},

However, most research so far ignores that language use is related to the social identity of speakers, which may be different from their biological identity. In this paper, we combine insights from sociolinguistics with data collected through an online game, to underline the importance of approaching age and gender as social variables rather than static biological variables. In our game, thousands of players guessed the gender and age of Twitter users based on tweets alone. We show that more than 10{\%} of the Twitter users do not employ language that the crowd associates with their biological sex. It is also shown that older Twitter users are often perceived to be younger. Our findings highlight the limitations of current approaches to gender and age prediction from texts.},

Thus the ability to classify latent user attributes, including gender, age, regional origin, and political orientation solely fromTwitter user language or similar highly informal content has important applications in advertising, personalization, and recommendation. This paper includes a novel investigation of stacked-SVM-based classification algorithms over a rich set of original features, applied to classifying these four user attributes. It also in- cludes extensive analysis of features and approaches that are effective and not effective in classifying user attributes in Twitter-style informal written genres as distinct from the other primarily spoken genres previously studied in the user- property classification literature. Our models, singly and in ensemble, significantly outperform baseline models in all cases. A detailed analysis of model components and fea- tures provides an often entertaining insight into distinctive language-usage variation across gender, age, regional origin and political orientation inmodern informal communication.},

In that more recent tradition we frame author age prediction from text as a regression problem. We explore the same task using three very different genres of data simultaneously: blogs, telephone conversations, and online forum posts. We employ a technique from domain adaptation that allows us to train a joint model involving all three corpora together as well as separately and analyze differences in predictive features across joint and corpus-specific aspects of the model. Effective features include both stylistic ones (such as POS patterns) as well as content oriented ones. Using a linear regression model based on shallow text features, we obtain correlations up to 0.74 and mean absolute errors between 4.1 and 6.8 years.},

abstract = {Transmitting messages in the most efficient way as possible has always been one of politicians' main concerns during electoral processes. Due to the rapidly growing number of users, online social networks have become ideal platforms for politicians to interact with their potential voters. Exploiting the available potential of these tools to maximize their influence over voters is one of politicians' actual challenges. To step in this direction, we have analyzed the user activity in the online social network Twitter, during the 2011 Spanish Presidential electoral process, and found that such activity is correlated with the election results. We introduce a new measure to study political sentiment in Twitter, which we call the relative support. We have also characterized user behavior by analyzing the structural and dynamical patterns of the complex networks emergent from the mention and retweet networks. Our results suggest that the collective attention is driven by a very small fraction of users. Furthermore, we have analyzed the interactions taking place among politicians, observing a lack of debate. Finally, we develop a network growth model to reproduce the interactions taking place among politicians.},

Higher inequality is thought to increase demand for government income redistribution in democracies and to discourage democratization and promote class conflict and revolution in dictatorships. Most such arguments crucially assume that ordinary people know how high inequality is, how it has been changing, and where they fit in the income distribution. Using a variety of large, cross-national surveys, we show that, in recent years, ordinary people have had little idea about such things. What they think they know is often wrong. Widespread ignorance and misperceptions of inequality emerge robustly, regardless of the data source, operationalization, and method of measurement. Moreover, we show that the perceived level of inequality???and not the actual level???correlates strongly with demand for redistribution and reported conflict between rich and poor. We suggest that most theories about political effects of inequality need to be either abandoned or reframed as theories about the effects of perceived inequality.},

It is only necessary to see the number of scientific publications and forums or related conferences to understand that this is a field with great prospects for the future. On the other hand, the Twitter boom has boosted investigation in this area due fundamentally to its potential applications in areas such as business or government intelligence, recommender systems, graphical interfaces and virtual assistance. However, to fully understand this issue, a profound revision of the state of the art is first necessary. It is for this reason that this paper aims to represent a starting point for those investigations concerned with the latest references to Twitter in SA.},

	Abstract = {Even though considerable attention has been given to the polarity of words (positive and negative) and the creation of large polarity lexicons, research in emotion analysis has had to rely on limited and small emotion lexicons. In this paper we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be used to generate a large, high-quality, wordemotion and wordpolarity association lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion- annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher inter-annotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe how we created two state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to de- tect the sentiment of messages such as tweets and SMS (message-level task) and one to de- tect the sentiment of a term within a message (term-level task). Among submissions from 44 teams in a competition, our submissions stood first in both tasks on tweets, obtaining an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the term-level task. We imple- mented a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features. We also generated two large word--sentiment association lexi- cons, one from tweets with sentiment-word hashtags, and one from tweets with emoticons. In the message-level task, the lexicon-based features provided a gain of 5 F-score points over all others. Both of our systems can be replicated using freely available resources.},

Our theory shows that sociotropic voting is consistent with self-interested behavior. We test our theory using both cross-sectional and time- series survey data. A novel survey instrument that asks respondents their numerical assessment of the unemployment rate confirms that individuals' economic information responds to the economic conditions of people similar to themselves. Further, these assessments associate with individuals' vote choices. We also show in time-series data that state unemployment robustly correlates with evaluations of national economic conditions and presidential support.},

	Abstract = {In 2001 and 2003, the Bush administration engineered two enormous tax cuts primarily benefiting very wealthy taxpayers.Most Americans supported these tax cuts. I argue that they did so not because they were indifferent to economic inequality, but because they largely failed to connect inequality and public policy. Three out of every four people polled said that the difference in incomes between rich people and poor people has increased in the past 20 years, and most of them added that that is a bad thing---but most of those people still supported the regressive 2001 Bush tax cut and the even more regressive repeal of the estate tax. Several mani- festly relevant considerations had negligible or seemingly perverse effects on these policy views, including assessments of the waste- fulness of government spending and desires for additional spending on a variety of government programs. Support for the Bush tax cuts was strongly shaped by people's attitudes about their own tax burdens, but virtually unaffected by their attitudes about the tax burden of the rich---even in the case of the estate tax, which only affects the wealthiest one or two percent of taxpayers. Public opinion in this instance was ill informed, insensitive to some of the most important implications of the tax cuts, and largely dis- connected from (or misconnected to) a variety of relevant values and material interests.},

	Abstract = {This article analyzes the processes of distribution and redistribution in postindustrial democracies. The authors combine a pooled time-series data base on welfare state effort and its determinants assembled by Huber, Ragin, and Stephens (1997) with data on income distribution assembled in the Luxembourg Income Survey (LIS) archive. In the case of the LIS data, the authors recalculate the microdata in order to remove the distorting influence of pensioners on pretax, pretransfer income distribution. They examine the determinants of two dependent variables: pretax, pretransfer income inequality and the proportional reduction in inequality from pre- to post-tax and transfer inequality. They test hypotheses derived from power resources theory against alternatives derived from the literature on the development of the welfare state and the determinants of income inequality. The results offer strong support for power resources theory, particularly in the case of reduction in inequality. Union density, unemployment, and percentage of female-headed households were the main determinants of pre-tax and transfer inequality ( \{$\backslash$rm R\}\^{}\{2\} = .64), while leftist government, directly and indirectly through its influence on the size of the welfare state, was found to be by far the strongest determinant of distribution ( \{$\backslash$rm R\}\^{}\{2\} = .81).},

	Abstract = {Empirical findings concerns economic voting differ according to the level of analysis employed.  A widely acceped explanation for the inconsistency between macro- and micro-level evidence of economic voting is the high degree of random variation that plagues survey data.  According to this explanation, aggregation purges individual-level "noise" from mass opinions on policy issues and outcomes.  Building on the research of Bartels (1996), we debate the validity of this explanation by demonstration that public evaluations of the national economy vary systemmatically with information, media exposure, political attitudes, personal experiences, and demographic characteristics.  Furthermore, we show that these sources of subjective heterogeneity produce systematic biases when national economic evaluations are aggregated.  These findings challenge a widely accepted notion that because "error" in individual-level measures (or expressions) of preferences is random, the aggregation of these individual measures ensures that they correctly represent the collective preference.},

This model explores how political and economic institutions alter the quality of the signal that the previous economy provides about the competence of candidates. The rational economic voter is also attentive to strategic cues regarding the responsibility of parties for economic outcomes and their electoral competitiveness. Theoretical propositions are derived linking variation in economic and political institutions to variability in economic voting. The authors demonstrate that there is economic voting, and that it varies significantly across political contexts, and then test explanations for this variation derived from their theory. The data consist of 165 election studies conducted in 19 different countries over a 20-year time period."--BOOK JACKET.},

@article{Gomez2001,
	Abstract = {This article presents a theory of het- erogeneous attribution, in which an individual's ability to make causal associations depends on his level of political sophistication. Specifically, we maintain that political sophistica- tion dramatically influences the rela- tive importance of personal and na- tional economic judgments in shaping presidential candidate pref- erence. Pocketbook voting, we argue, should be common only among rela- tively sophisticated voters, who are able to make the associative linkage between changes in their personal financial status and governmental policy. Additionally, we hypothesize that sociotropic evaluations should be most influential for less sophisticated voters. Low sophisticates, we argue, will tend to assume that the national economy is entirely in the President's hands (and vote accordingly), whereas more sophisticated voters understand that the economy is af- fected by many actors and conditions that are largely beyond the Presi- dent's control. Testing our theory using data from 1992, 1996, and 1998, we find strong support for our hypotheses.},

@article{Hetherington1996,
	Abstract = {In terms of economic voting, voters' perceptions of economic indicators can be more important than the statistics themselves. This distinction is particularly important in understanding George Bush's defeat in 1992. Relentlessly negative reporting on economic performance during the election year negatively affected voters' perceptions of the economy. These altered perceptions influenced voting behavior. Ordinary least squares regression is used to demonstrate the media's impact on economic evaluations. Logistic regression is used to demonstrate the importance of economic evaluations in vote choice. Media consumption and attention to the presidential campaign through the mass media negatively shaped voters' retrospective economic assessments. These assessments were significantly related to vote choice. This suggests an explanation for why George Bush lost reelection despite an economy that had rebounded from recession well in advance of election day.},

	Abstract = {Perceptions of economic performance are a cornerstone of American public opinion, and are strongly correlated with Presidential approval. Yet much of our knowledge about economic perceptions comes from political surveys conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Past evidence has limited over-time variation, much of it predating the recent increase in income inequality. This paper updates our understanding of economic perceptions by combining the 1978-2003 Michigan Surveys of Consumer Attitudes with various economic indicators. Snapshots from elections create the impression that Americans' assessments of economic performance are influenced only by income growth among the wealthy. Examining 185,000 respondents to a monthly survey over 26 years, however, we learn that income growth among the poor is frequently more influential, especially among those with lower incomes themselves. Echoing findings of a ``rational public,'' Americans' aggregate economic assessments appear to be grounded in the economic conditions relevant to their levels of income.},

@article{Krause1997,
	Abstract = {Theory: It is argued here that previous studies analyzing the formation of voters' economic expectations overlook important subtleties found in a differentiated (heterogeneous) electorate. Since different segments of the electorate possess varying information capabilities, it is asserted that they will form their prospective economic evaluations differently from one another. Hypotheses: The impact of "expectational" electoral cycles, news coverage of the economy reported by voters, retrospective economic evaluations, and personal financial expectations are hypothesized to have a differential impact on their economic expectations based on varying levels of information (education) among subsets of the electorate. Methods: Time series multiple regression analysis is conducted for the monthly period between January 1978 and December 1990. The empirical analysis involves testing for the properties of the statistical time series (i.e., integration and cointegration) as well as specification of an error correction mechanism (ECM) that captures long-run statistical relationships in appropriate circumstances. Results: These findings uncover electoral heterogeneity (based on information/education differences) with respect to voters' prospective economic evaluations. Specifically, the information capabilities of voters is inversely related to their reliance on past/retrospective sources of information when forming both egocentric and sociotropic economic expectations. The main implication of this research is that the assumption of electoral homogeneity contained in previous longitudinal analyses of aggregate economic opinion formation provides misleading results that either overlook intra-electoral variations, introduce aggregation bias, or possibly both.},

@article{Mackuen1992,
	Abstract = {The usual mode of electoral reaction to economic conditions assumes the "retrospective" economic voter who bases expectations solely on recent economic performance or personal economic experience (voter as "peasant"). A second model assumes a "sophisticated" economic voter who incorporates new information about the future into personal economic expectations (voter as "banker"). Using the components, both retrospective and prospective, of the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) as intervening variables between economic conditions and approval, we find that the prospective component fully accounts for the presideintial approval time series.With aggregate consumer expectations about long-term buisness conditions in the approval equation, neither the usual economic indicators not the other ICS componenets matter. Moreover, short-term changes in consumer expectations respond more to current forecasts than to the current econom. The qualitative result is a rational expectations outcome: the electorate anticipates the economic future and rewards or punishes the president for economic events before they happen.},

	Abstract = {Why is it that some countries have witnessed significant increases in inequality since the 1960s while at the same time experiencing very little change in the way politics is conducted? And why is it that in other countries, where inequality has increased much less, the Left has become substantially more redistributive? The answer, the authors argue, has to do with the interaction between inequality and political mobilization of low-income voters. The authors make two points in this article. First, high levels of inequality move Left parties to the left. Second, although increasing inequality pushes the core constituencies of Left parties to the left, it also makes some individuals less likely to be involved in politics. The authors argue that Left parties will respond to an increase in inequality only when low-income voters are politically mobilized. They explore these claims through a comparative analysis of Left party programs in 10 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries over the period 1966 to 2002.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT Why has the American political landscape grown more partisan$\backslash$nsince the 1970s? This article provides a novel account of the determinants$\backslash$nof partisanship. The author argues that partisanship is not only$\backslash$nshaped by the traditionally suggested socio-economic factors, but$\backslash$nalso by the uncertainty of future income (risk exposure): rich individuals$\backslash$nfacing a high degree of risk exposure (or poor people facing low$\backslash$nrisk exposure) are `cross-pressured'; while their income suggests$\backslash$nthat they should identify with the Republicans, their income prospects$\backslash$nmake them sympathize with the Democrats. These two traits have overlapped$\backslash$nincreasingly since the 1970s. Those with lower incomes tend to be$\backslash$nalso those with higher risk exposure (risk inequality increased).$\backslash$nThis has led to a sorting of the American electorate: more citizens$\backslash$nhave become `natural' partisans. },

	Abstract = {A common claim in debates about globalization is that economic integration increases worker$\backslash$ninsecurity. Although this idea is central to both political and academic debates about$\backslash$ninternational economic integration, the theoretical basis of the claim is often not clear. There is$\backslash$nalso no empirical research that has directly tested the relationship. In this paper, we argue that economic insecurity among workers may be related to deteriorating employment and/or wage interactions with employers, and that foreign direct investment may a key factor contributing to this deterioration. We present new empirical evidence, based on the analysis of panel data from$\backslash$nGreat Britain collected from 1991-1999, that FDI activity in the industries in which individuals$\backslash$nwork is positively correlated with individual perceptions of economic insecurity. This relationship holds in yearly cross-sections, in a panel accounting for individual-specific effects, and in a dynamic panel model also accounting for individual-specific effects.},

	Abstract = {Strategies for reducing tax evasion include stricter enforcement, but taxpayer responses to increased enforcement are difficult to measure with field data. We use experimental methods to examine individual compliance responses to advance information on audit probability and productivity. Our design informs some individuals that their return will be audited prior to making their compliance decision, while other individuals receive information that they will not be audited; we also inform individuals of the productivity (fraction of unreported income discovered) of the audit. Announcement increases compliance of those told they will be audited, but reduces compliance of those knowing they will not be audited; the net effect is that overall compliance falls.

If the proposal was accepted, each group member received an equal share of his group???s payoff (the pie in the group condition was three times that in the individual condition). In both experiments, groups offered less than individuals. But as indicated by the low rejection rate in both treatments, groups were also willing to accept less.},

We derive and test competing predictions for the two dominant psychological theories of group polarisation in this context. The data indicate that team choices tend to be dominated by the more other-regarding member. This result is more consistent with Social Comparison Theory than Persuasive Argument Theory.},

	Abstract = {Advocates hope to influence the resource allocation decisions of legislators and other policy makers to capture more resources for mental health programs. Findings from social psychological research suggest factors that, if pursued, may improve advocacy efforts. In particular, allocation decisions are affected by policy makers' perceptions of the scarcity of resources, effectiveness of specific programs, needs of people who have problems that are served by these programs, and extent of personal responsibility for these problems. These perceptions are further influenced by political ideology. Conservatives are motivated by a tendency to punish persons who. are perceived as having personal responsibility for their problems by withholding resources, whereas liberals are likely to avoid tough allocation decisions. Moreover, these perceptions are affected by political accountability, that is, whether politicians perceive that their constituents will closely monitor their decisions. just as the quality of clinical interventions improves when informed by basic research on human behavior, the efforts of mental health advocates will be advanced when they understand the psychological forces that affect policy makers' decisions about resources.},

	Abstract = {We use a laboratory experiment to compare the way groups and individuals behave in an inter-temporal common pool dilemma. The experimental design distinguishes between a non-strategic problem where players (individuals or groups of three) make decisions without interaction and a strategic part where players harvest from a common pool. This allows us to correct for differences between individuals and groups in the quality of decisions when testing for differences in competitiveness. Group decisions are either made by majority rule or unanimity. The results show that groups are less myopic than individuals (i.e., they make qualitatively better decisions) but that they are more competitive than individuals when placed in a strategic setting. The net result for groups deciding by majority rule is that they make less efficient decisions in the strategic game than individuals do. We are able to show that this is caused by the median voter departing from her original preference in early periods witha shrinking pool. When groups have to make unanimous decisions they start playing the strategic game more efficiently then individuals do, but they rapidly become more competitive with repetition of the game.

	Abstract = {This article reviews the now extensive research literature addressing the impact of accountability on a wide range of social judgments and choices. It focuses on issues: (a) What impact do various accountability ground rules have on thoughts, feelings, and action? (b) Under what conditions will accountability attenuate, have no effect on, or amplify cognitive biases? (c) Does accountability alter how people think or merely what people say they think? and (d) What goals do accountable decision makers seek to achieve? In addition, this review explores the broader implications of accountability research. It highlights the utility of treating thought as a process of internalized dialogue; the importance of documenting social and institutional boundary conditions on putative cognitive biases; and the potential to craft empirical answers to such applied problems as how to structure accountability relationships in organizations.},

Using a within-subjects design we re-examine group polarization by letting subjects make individual as well as team decisions in an experimental dictator game. In our experiment teams are more selfish than individuals, and the most selfish team member has the strongest influence on team decisions. Various explanations for the different findings in Cason and Mui (1997) and in our paper are discussed.},

Although the decision rule the committee used to decide whether to accept or reject the offer had a large effect on the optimal allocation strategy, we hypothesized that allocators would have difficulty incorporating the implications of the committee's decision rule into their allocation decisions. Experiment 1 found subjects to be very insensitive to decision rule. In fact, decision rule had no effect on allocation decisions. Experiment 2 made the decision rule and its implications more obvious to subjects, but allocations still deviated from the strategies that would have maximized winnings. Experiment 3 provided convincing evidence that the reasons for these deviations from the maximizing strategy have to do with insensitivity to the implications of the group's decision rule and with the difficulty in thinking accurately about the cognitions of others.

We experimentally tested two perspectives: "rational," where the other was expected to accept any amount offered because it would be better than nothing, and "fair," where the other was expected to use fairness as the criterion for evaluating the offer. The latter perspective implies a need to show greater cooperation, i.e., to make more generous ultimatum offers. The results supported the hypotheses that groups adopt more of a rational perspective than individuals, and that offers to outgroups reflect a rational perspective more than offers to ingroups. The preference of the most competitive individual in the group was the best predictor of the group's ultimatum offer. The perspective adopted by the group had lasting effects, as individuals tended to adopt the level of competitiveness of their groups in subsequent individual ultimatum games.

In order to assess whether the discontinuity effect is partially driven by the individual anonymity inherent in group decisions, a laboratory experiment was conducted in which group members' votes for the choices on a PDG-Alt matrix were, or were not, to be known by the members of the other group. The results indicated that group members who anticipated that their votes would be identified by the other group made fewer competitive choices and more cooperative choices. A number of different possible theoretical interpretations of these results were discussed. Separate results from a variety of assessments provided evidence for the fear and greed interpretation of discontinuity. It was found, for example, that discussions between groups contained more distrust and greed statements than did discussions between individuals. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract ={This paper presents the results of two randomized experiments conducted in schools in urban India. A remedial education program hired young women to teach students lagging behind in basic literacy and numeracy skills. It increased average test scores of all children in treatment schools by 0.28 standard deviation, mostly due to large gains experienced by children at the bottom of the test-score distribution. A computer-assisted learning program focusing on math increased math scores by 0.47 standard deviation. One year after the programs were over, initial gains remained significant for targeted children, but they faded to about 0.10 standard deviation.},

	Abstract = {Person perception includes three sequential processes: categorization (what is the actor doing?), characterization (what trait does the action imply?), and correction (what situational constraints may have caused the action?). We argue that correction is less automatic (i.e., more easily disrupted) than either categorization or characterization. In Experiment 1, subjects observed a target behave anxiously in an anxiety-provoking situation. In Experiment 2, subjects listened to a target read a political speech that he had been constrained to write. In both experiments, control subjects used information about situational constraints when drawing inferences about the target, but cognitively busy subjects (who performed an additional cognitive task during encoding) did not. The results (a) suggest that person perception is a combination of lower and higher order processes that differ in their susceptibility to disruption and (b) highlight the fundamental differences between active and passive perceivers.},

    abstract = { We develop a model that calls into question some longstanding presumptions about incumbency advantage. Our results show that increases in some of the ostensible benefits of incumbency frequently cited in the empirical and theoretical literature make it difficult for voters to differentiate incumbents of higher and lower quality. While this leads to an improvement in the electoral prospects of lower-quality incumbents, it is harmful to those of higher quality. Whether the net electoral consequence for high-quality incumbents is positive or negative depends on whether the source of incumbency advantage affects candidate entry and exit decisions directly or indirectly, as mediated through voters??? choices. Our findings suggest, further, that fundamental tensions may exist between different sources of incumbency advantage, and point to obstacles to disaggregating the sources of incumbency advantage empirically. }

	Abstract = {Presents a summary and synthesis of the author's work on attribution theory concerning the mechanisms involved in the process of causal explanations. The attribution theory is related to studies of social perception, self-perception, and psychological epistemology. Two systematic statements of attribution theory are described, discussed, and illustrated with empirical data: the covariation and the configuration concepts. Some problems for attribution theory are considered, including the interplay between preconceptions and new information, simple vs. complex schemata, attribution of covariation among causes, and illusions in attributions. The role of attribution in decision making and behavior is discussed.},

	Abstract = {In summary, this is a book about the predictability and coherence of behavior as seen from the perspective of modern experimental and cognitive social psychology. We begin with the history of research suggesting that situational factors often prove to be more powerful determinants of behavior that the vast majority of us???scientists and laypeople alike???would have guessed. Implicit in this situationist lesson is the suggestion that people from different backgrounds, people with different beliefs, even people with apparently different personalities, must understand and react to some situations rather uniformly.

At the same time, research and everyday observation constantly remind us that people often do differ dramatically both in their responses to particular situations and events and in the patterns of their everyday behavior. We will argue that the shared convictions that laypeople have about stable, consistent, coherent, and predictable individual differences are not always mere cognitive illusions. Rather, they are based, at least to a substantial degree, on the data of everyday experience. Far from disputing the existence or significance of individual differences, we will acknowledge them and then explore their bases and implications. More specifically, we will provide a "situationist" and "subjectivist" account of individual differences???one that gives heavy weight to the complex dynamics of social systems and to the role of construal processes. Our goal will thus be an account of individual differences that seeks to explain what kinds of differences are likely to exist and be important, when they are likely to be obscured, and when misinterpretations of such differences are likely to arise.},

	Abstract = {Attribution theories have not specified whether attributions are made by perceivers as part of the process of comprehending an event or only later in response to specific attributional questions. Theories also disagree about the types of attributional inferences (judgments of causation, of the actor's traits, or of intentionality) that are most likely to be made initially and to mediate further inferences. Whereas previous research has been unable to address these issues, a design using 2 RT measures provided relevant evidence. Results of 2 studies involving 100 undergraduates show that judgments of intention and of the actor's traits may have been made in the process of comprehension; affective judgments and inferences about the repetition of an event and the event's personal or situational causation were probably made later. Implications for a model of schema-based attributional inference are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present a unified model of turnout and vote choice that incorporates two distinct motivations for citizens to abstain from voting: alienation from the candidates, and indifference between the candidates. Empirically, we find that alienation and indifference each motivated significant amounts of voter abstention in the 1980-1988 U.S. presidential elections. Using model-based computer simulations-which permit us to manipulate factors affecting turnout-we show that distinguishing between alienation and indifference illuminates three controversies in elections research. First, we find that abstention because of either alienation or indifference benefited Republican candidates, but only very modestly. Second, presidential elections involving attractive candidates motivate higher turnout, but only to the extent that abstention stems from alienation rather than from indifference. Third, paradoxically, citizens' individual-level tendencies to abstain because of alienation are strongly affected by their evaluations of the candidates' policies, whereas aggregate turnout rates do not depend significantly on the candidates' policy platforms.},

	Abstract = {An appealing feature of multiple imputation is he simplicity of the
	rules for combining the multiple complete-data inferences into a
	final inference, the repeated-imputation inference (Rubin, 1987).
	This inference is based on a t distribution and is derived from a
	Bayesian paradigm under the assumption that the complete-data degrees
	of freedom, ??com, are infinite, but the number of imputations, m,
	is finite. When ??com is small and there is only a modest proportion
	of missing data, the calculated repeated-imputation degrees of freedom,
	??m, for the t reference distribution can be much larger than ??com,
	which is clearly inappropriate. Following the Bayesian paradigm,
	we derive an adjusted degrees of freedom, ????m, with the following
	three properties: for fixed m and estimated fraction of missing information,
	????m monotonically increases in ??com; ????m is always less than or equal
	to ??com; and ????m equals ??m when ??com is infinite. A small simulation
	study demonstrates the superior frequentist performance when using
	????m rather than ??m.},

	have a strong influence on attitudes to welfare. To investigate these

	Abstract = {This study analyzes the effects of income on voting behavior and the outcome of presidential elections in the U.S. since 1952. The political effects of income have not been examined using appropriate measures and systematic analysis of individual-level data. Our analyses build from political behavior research on economic evaluations and sociological and economic research on trends in income distribution. We first consider the theoretical grounds for expecting income to have shaped voting behavior in the postwar era. Our analysis then shows that while income has had a significant and generally stable impact on voting behavior, cumulative changes in mean household income have had a very large effect on the outcome of presidential elections since the 1950s, with Republican candidates benefiting disproportionately. We find that household income shapes voting behavior indirectly, affecting policy evaluations, which in turn influence vote choice. The mediating roles played by evaluations of social welfare and government size help to explain why past increases in mean income have consistently benefited the Republican party. We discuss the contributions of this study to understanding income as an important but underappreciated source of political change in the U.S.},

Analysis of cross-country survey data reveals that this correlation disappears among religious individuals in countries that use proportional representation. This is the case in large part because there is a moral values dimension that has a correlation with income that is equal in magnitude but has the opposite sign as the economic dimension, and the votes of the religious are better explained by their positions on moral than economic issues, especially in countries with multiparty systems. The authors conclude by discussing implications for theories of redistribution.},

	Abstract = {This article employs multilevel modeling to assess the importance
	of income inequality on the demand for redistribution in a sample
	of 22 European countries. According to standard political economy
	models of redistribution -- notably the Meltzer-Richard model --
	inequality and demand for redistribution should be positively linked.
	However, existing empirical research has disputed this claim. The
	main advantages of this article is that demand for redistribution
	is measured at the individual level, and that the relevant interaction
	between inequality and own income is considered. The main findings
	are that inequality is positively associated with demand for redistribution,
	and that the median income person is sensitive to the level of inequality.
	These findings are robust to the inclusion of a range of relevant
	control variables. The results are relevant in relation to the increase
	in inequalities in many European countries, and especially relevant
	to the current debate about the importance of directly observable
	differences in public preferences for social policy outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Britain and Germany have been experiencing significant changes in
	the nature of work and welfare since the 1990s. Although important
	differences have remained, there have been compelling indications
	of a dual transformation of welfare constituted not only by a far-reaching
	retrenchment in unemployment insurance but also by a remarkable expansion
	in family policy. These developments have their functional underpinnings
	in accelerating deindustrialization with a declining proportion of
	the male workforce with specific skills as well as in service sector
	growth and rising female labor market participation characterized
	by an increase in general skills. As the aggregate effect of economic
	fluctuations in industrial production has diminished over time, the
	relative incidence of work disruptions that have arisen from maternity
	and child-rearing has increased substantially. This dual transformation
	in welfare and employment patterns suggests that the process of deindustrialization
	has initiated significant path adjustments unanticipated in the existing
	comparative political economy literature.},

We analyze two-outcome and multiple-outcome models, including ordered and unordered choice models. We allow for transition-specific and general instruments. We generalize previous analyses by developing weights for treatment effects for general instruments. We develop a simple test for the presence of essential heterogeneity. We note the asymmetry of the model of essential heterogeneity: outcomes of choices are heterogeneous in a general way; choices are not. When both choices and outcomes are permitted to be symmetrically heterogeneous, the method of IV breaks down for estimating treatment parameters.},

	Abstract = {Ecological inference is a statistical problem where aggregate-level data are used to make inferences about individual-level behavior. In this article, we conduct a theoretical and empirical study of Bayesian and likelihood inference for 2 x 2 ecological tables by applying the general statistical framework of incomplete data. We first show that the ecological inference problem can be decomposed into three factors: distributional effects, which address the possible misspecification of parametric modeling assumptions about the unknown distribution of missing data; contextual effects, which represent the possible correlation between missing data and observed variables; and aggregation effects, which are directly related to the loss of information caused by data aggregation. We then examine how these three factors affect inference and offer new statistical methods to address each of them. To deal with distributional effects, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model based on a Dirichlet process prior, which relaxes common parametric assumptions. We also identify the statistical adjustments necessary to account for contextual effects. Finally, although little can be done to cope with aggregation effects, we offer a method to quantify the magnitude of such effects in order to formally assess its severity. We use simulated and real data sets to empirically investigate the consequences of these three factors and to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods. C code, along with an easy-to-use R interface, is publicly available for implementing our proposed methods (Imai, Lu, and Strauss, forthcoming).},

	Abstract = {Traditionally in the social sciences, causal mediation analysis has been formulated, understood, and implemented within the framework of linear structural equation models. We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

	Abstract = {We present a theory of social policy preferences that emphasizes the
	composition of people's skills. The key to our argument is that individuals
	who have made risky investments in skills will demand insurance against
	the possible future loss of income from those investments. Because
	the transferability of skills is inversely related to their specificity,
	workers with specific skills face a potentially long spell of unemployment
	or a significant decline in income in the event of job loss. Workers
	deriving most of their income from specific skills therefore have
	strong incentives to support social policies that protect them against
	such uncertainty. This is not the case for general skills workers,
	for whom the costs of social protection weigh more prominently. We
	test the theory on public opinion data for eleven advanced democracies
	and suggest how differences in educational systems can help explain
	cross-national differences in the level of social protection.},

	Abstract = {Previous sociological studies have paid little attention to religion
	as a central determinant of individual preferences for redistribution.
	In this article we argue that religious individuals, living in increasingly
	secular societies, differ in political preferences from their secular
	counterparts. Based on the theory of religious cleavages, we expect
	that religious individuals will oppose income redistribution by the
	state. Furthermore, in contexts where the polarization between religious
	and secular individuals is large, preferences for redistribution
	will be lower. In the empirical analysis we test our predictions
	in a multilevel framework, using data from the European Social Survey
	2002--2006 for 16 Western European countries. After controlling for
	a wide range of individual socio-economic factors and for welfare-state
	policies, religion plays and important explanatory role. We find
	that both Catholics and Protestants strongly oppose income redistribution
	by the state. The cleavage between religious and secular individuals
	is far more important than the difference between denominations.
	Using a refined measure of religious polarization, we also find that
	in more polarized context the overall level of support for redistribution
	is lower.},

@book{AngristPischke2008,
	Abstract = {The core methods in today's econometric toolkit are linear regression for statistical control, instrumental variables methods for the analysis of natural experiments, and differences-in-differences methods that exploit policy changes. In the modern experimentalist paradigm, these techniques address clear causal questions such as: Do smaller classes increase learning? Should wife batterers be arrested? How much does education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to speak. In addition to econometric essentials, Mostly Harmless Econometrics covers important new extensions--regression-discontinuity designs and quantile regression--as well as how to get standard errors right. Joshua Angrist and J{\"o}rn-Steffen Pischke explain why fancier econometric techniques are typically unnecessary and even dangerous. The applied econometric methods emphasized in this book are easy to use and relevant for many areas of contemporary social science. An irreverent review of econometric essentials A focus on tools that applied researchers use most Chapters on regression-discontinuity designs, quantile regression, and standard errors Many empirical examples A clear and concise resource with wide applications},

@book{McCarthyPooleRosenthal2008,
	Abstract = {The idea of America as politically polarized---that there is an unbridgeable
	divide between right and left, red and blue states---has become a
	clich{\'e}. What commentators miss, however, is that increasing polarization
	in recent decades has been closely accompanied by fundamental social
	and economic changes---most notably, a parallel rise in income inequality.
	In Polarized America, Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole, and Howard Rosenthal
	examine the relationships of polarization, wealth disparity, immigration,
	and other forces, characterizing it as a dance of give and take and
	back and forth causality. Using NOMINATE (a quantitative procedure
	that, like interest group ratings, scores politicians on the basis
	of their roll call voting records) to measure polarization in Congress
	and public opinion, census data and Federal Election Commission finance
	records to measure polarization among the public, the authors find
	that polarization and income inequality fell in tandem from 1913
	to 1957 and rose together dramatically from 1977 on; they trace a
	parallel rise in immigration beginning in the 1970s. They show that
	Republicans have moved right, away from redistributive policies that
	would reduce income inequality. Immigration, meanwhile, has facilitated
	the move to the right: non-citizens, a larger share of the population
	and disproportionately poor, cannot vote; thus there is less political
	pressure from the bottom for redistribution than there is from the
	top against it. In "the choreography of American politics" inequality
	feeds directly into political polarization, and polarization in turn
	creates policies that further increase inequality.},

abstract = {Increasingly, experimental research is being conducted on the Internet in addition to the laboratory. Online experiments are more convenient for subjects and researchers, but we know little about how the choice of study location affects data quality. To investigate whether respondent behavior differs across study location, we randomly assign subjects to participate in a study in a laboratory or in an online setting. Contrary to our expectations, we find few differences between participants in terms of the level of attention and socially desirable responding. However, we find significant differences in two areas: the degree of self-reported distractions while completing the questionnaire and the tendency to consult outside sources for answers to political knowledge questions. We conclude that when the greater convenience (and higher response rates) of online experiments outweighs these disadvantages, Internet administration of randomized experiments represent an alternative to laboratory administration.},

	Abstract = {One important puzzle in international political economy is why lower-earning and less-skilled intensive industries tend to receive relatively high levels of trade protection.  This pattern of protection holds even in low-income countries in which less-skilled labor is likely to be the relatively abundant factor of production and therefore would be expected in many standard political-economy frameworks to receive relatively low, not high, levels of protection.  We propose and model one possible explanation: that individual aversion to inequality---both envy and altruism---lead to systematic differences in support for trade protection across industries, with sectors employing lower-earning workers more intensively being relatively preferred recipients for trade protection.  We conduct original survey experiments in China and the United States and provide strong evidence that individual policy opinions about sector-specific trade protection depend on the earnings of workers in the sector.  We also present structural estimates of the influence of envy and altruism on sector-specific trade policy preferences.  Our estimates indicate that both envy and altruism influence support for trade protection in the United States and that altruism influences policy opinions in China.},

In the context of the 2009 German federal election, we conducted a sentiment analysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is used extensively for political deliberation and that the mere number of party mentions accurately reflects the election result. The tweets' sentiment (e.g., positive and negative emotions associated with a politician) corresponds closely to voters' political preferences. In addition, party sentiment profiles reflect the similarity of political positions between parties. We derive suggestions for further research and discuss the use of microblogging services to aggregate dispersed information.},

Sandner, and Isabell M. Welpe (TSSW) the authors claim that it would be possible to predict election outcomes in Germany by examining the relative frequency of the mentions of political parties in Twitter messages posted during the election campaign. In this response we show that the results of TSSW are contingent on arbitrary choices of the authors. We demonstrate that as of yet the relative frequency of mentions of German political parties in Twitter message allows no prediction of election results.},

@article{Lampos2013,
abstract = {Social Media contain a multitude of user opinions which can be used to predict real-world phenomena in many domains including politics, finance and health. Most existing methods treat these problems as linear regression, learning to relate word frequencies and other simple features to a known response variable (e.g., voting intention polls or financial indicators). These techniques require very careful filtering of the input texts, as most Social Media posts are irrelevant to the task. In this paper, we present a novel approach which performs high quality filtering automatically, through modelling not just words but also users, framed as a bilinear model with a sparse regulariser. We also consider the problem of modelling groups of related output variables, using a structured multi-task regularisation method. Our experiments on voting intention prediction demonstrate strong performance over large-scale input from Twitter on two distinct case studies, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.},

In our experiment subjects toss a coin in private and report the outcome (white or black). We reward only those who report white and leave them the possibility to cheat without being discovered. In our 2??2 experimental design, we manipulated subjects??? report sheet to (i) suggest (or not) that cheating is an option; (ii) suggest that their peers were honest (or dishonest). We find that increasing awareness of cheating as an option significantly increases the probability that women cheat; whereas men ??? who are already aware that cheating is an option ??? are not affected. When we suggest that peers have cheated, men cheat significantly more, whereas women do not."

	abstract = { In this paper we distinguish between two types of white lies: those that help others at the expense of the person telling the lie, which we term altruistic white lies, and those that help both others and the liar, which we term Pareto white lies. We find that a large fraction of participants are reluctant to tell even a Pareto white lie, demonstrating a pure lie aversion independent of any social preferences for outcomes. In contrast, a nonnegligible fraction of participants are willing to tell an altruistic white lie that hurts them a bit but significantly helps others. Comparing white lies to those where lying increases the liar's payoff at the expense of another reveals important insights into the interaction of incentives, lying aversion, and preferences for payoff distributions. Finally, in line with previous findings, women are less likely to lie when it is costly to the other side. Interestingly though, we find that women are more likely to tell an altruistic lie. This paper was accepted by Teck Ho, decision analysis. }

We elicit subjects??? beliefs, risk and other-regarding preferences. Our design also allows us to examine the behavior of subjects in both roles, to determine whether the behavior in one role is the best response to the subject's own behavior in the other role. The results of the experiment indicate that, when acting as senders, the majority of subjects adopt deceptive strategies by sending favorable message when the true state of the nature is unfavorable. When acting as receivers, the majority of subjects invest conditional upon receiving a favorable message. The investing behavior of receivers cannot be explained by risk preferences or as a best response to subject's own behavior in the sender's role. However, it can be rationalized by accounting for elicited beliefs and other-regarding preferences. Finally, the honest behavior of some senders can be explained by other-regarding preferences. Thus, we that find liars do believe, and that individuals who care about the payoffs of others tend to be honest."

Public perception that diverges from the scientific community may decrease the effectiveness of scientific inquiry and innovation as tools to solve these challenges. The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with the divergence of public opinion from scientific consensus regarding the safety of genetically modified (GM) foods and human involvement in global warming (GW). Results indicate that the effects of knowledge on public opinion are complex and non-uniform across types of knowledge (i.e., perceived and actual) or issues. Political affiliation affects agreement with science; Democrats were more likely to agree that GM food is safe and human actions cause GW. Respondents who had relatively higher cognitive function or held illusionary correlations about GM food or GW were more likely to have an opinion that differed from the scientific community.},

abstract="An extensive literature addresses citizen ignorance, but very little research focuses on misperceptions. Can these false or unsubstantiated beliefs about politics be corrected? Previous studies have not tested the efficacy of corrections in a realistic format. We conducted four experiments in which subjects read mock news articles that included either a misleading claim from a politician, or a misleading claim and a correction. Results indicate that corrections frequently fail to reduce misperceptions among the targeted ideological group. We also document several instances of a ``backfire effect'' in which corrections actually increase misperceptions among the group in question.",

	publisher = {American Academy of Pediatrics},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of messages designed to reduce vaccine misperceptions and increase vaccination rates for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR).METHODS: A Web-based nationally representative 2-wave survey experiment was conducted with 1759 parents age 18 years and older residing in the United States who have children in their household age 17 years or younger (conducted June{\textendash}July 2011). Parents were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 interventions: (1) information explaining the lack of evidence that MMR causes autism from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) textual information about the dangers of the diseases prevented by MMR from the Vaccine Information Statement; (3) images of children who have diseases prevented by the MMR vaccine; (4) a dramatic narrative about an infant who almost died of measles from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fact sheet; or to a control group.RESULTS: None of the interventions increased parental intent to vaccinate a future child. Refuting claims of an MMR/autism link successfully reduced misperceptions that vaccines cause autism but nonetheless decreased intent to vaccinate among parents who had the least favorable vaccine attitudes. In addition, images of sick children increased expressed belief in a vaccine/autism link and a dramatic narrative about an infant in danger increased self-reported belief in serious vaccine side effects.CONCLUSIONS: Current public health communications about vaccines may not be effective. For some parents, they may actually increase misperceptions or reduce vaccination intention. Attempts to increase concerns about communicable diseases or correct false claims about vaccines may be especially likely to be counterproductive. More study of pro-vaccine messaging is needed.},

It first discusses a number of challenges facing any effort to communicate science in social environments: lay publics with varying levels of preparedness for fully understanding new scientific breakthroughs; the deterioration of traditional media infrastructures; and an increasingly complex set of emerging technologies that are surrounded by a host of ethical, legal, and social considerations. Based on this overview, I discuss four areas in which empirical social science helps clarify intuitive but sometimes faulty assumptions about the social-level mechanisms of science communication and outline an agenda for bench and social scientists{\textemdash}driven by current social-scientific research in the field of science communication{\textemdash}to guide more effective communication efforts at the societal level in the future.},

    abstract = { Although the majority of studies on political knowledge document lingering gender-based differences in advanced industrial democracies, most contributors have drawn such conclusions from a single or a handful of countries, using limited batteries of political information items. Exploiting a pooled data set of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems encompassing 106 post-election surveys in forty-seven countries between 1996 and 2011, this article demonstrates that survey instrument?related factors, such as question format and content, as well as the overall difficulty of questions, are more consequential in shaping the size of gender gaps in political knowledge than institutional factors, such as electoral rules or opportunity structures. The research design of this article draws from almost three hundred different items measuring factual political knowledge using the broadest country coverage and most comprehensive approach to measurement to date. }

	Abstract = {The overall effect of an exposure on an outcome, in the presence of a mediator with which the exposure may interact, can be decomposed into 4 components: (1) the effect of the exposure in the absence of the mediator, (2) the interactive effect when the mediator is left to what it would be in the absence of exposure, (3) a mediated interaction, and (4) a pure mediated effect. These 4 components, respectively, correspond to the portion of the effect that is due to neither mediation nor interaction, to just interaction (but not mediation), to both mediation and interaction, and to just mediation (but not interaction). This 4-way decomposition unites methods that attribute effects to interactions and methods that assess mediation. Certain combinations of these 4 components correspond to measures for mediation, whereas other combinations correspond to measures of interaction previously proposed in the literature. Prior decompositions in the literature are in essence special cases of this 4-way decomposition. The 4-way decomposition can be carried out using standard statistical models, and software is provided to estimate each of the 4 components. The 4-way decomposition provides maximum insight into how much of an effect is mediated, how much is due to interaction, how much is due to both mediation and interaction together, and how much is due to neither.},

When studying issues such as racial prejudice and support for militant groups, these survey methodologies may improve the validity of measurements by reducing nonresponse and social desirability biases. We develop a statistical test and multivariate regression models for comparing and combining the results from list and endorsement experiments. We demonstrate that when carefully designed and analyzed, the two survey experiments can produce substantively similar empirical findings. Such agreement is shown to be possible even when these experiments are applied to one of the most challenging research environments: contemporary Afghanistan. We find that both experiments uncover similar patterns of support for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) among Pashtun respondents. Our findings suggest that multiple measurement strategies can enhance the credibility of empirical conclusions. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose methods for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental and observational studies and for conducting hypothesis tests about the magnitude of differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without {\textquotedblleft}sparsity{\textquotedblright} assumptions. We propose an {\textquotedblleft}honest{\textquotedblright} approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the {\textquotedblleft}ground truth{\textquotedblright} for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90\% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74\% and 84\% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7{\textendash}22\%.},

We propose a model-??free approach for testing for the presence of such unexplained variation. To use this randomization-??based approach, we must address the fact that the average treatment effect, which is generally the object of interest in randomized experiments, actually acts as a nuisance parameter in this setting. We explore potential solutions and advocate for a method that guarantees valid tests in finite samples despite this nuisance. We also show how this method readily extends to testing for heterogeneity beyond a given model, which can be useful for assessing the sufficiency of a given scientific theory. We finally apply our method to the National Head Start impact study, which is a large-??scale randomized evaluation of a Federal preschool programme, finding that there is indeed significant unexplained treatment effect variation.}

	abstract = {Inferences from randomized experiments can be improved by blocking: assigning treatment in fixed proportions within groups of similar units. However, the use of the method is limited by the difficulty in deriving these groups. Current blocking methods are restricted to special cases or run in exponential time; are not sensitive to clustering of data points; and are often heuristic, providing an unsatisfactory solution in many common instances. We present an algorithm that implements a widely applicable class of blocking{\textemdash}threshold blocking{\textemdash}that solves these problems. Given a minimum required group size and a distance metric, we study the blocking problem of minimizing the maximum distance between any two units within the same group. We prove this is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard problem and derive an approximation algorithm that yields a blocking where the maximum distance is guaranteed to be, at most, four times the optimal value. This algorithm runs in O(n log n) time with O(n) space complexity. This makes it, to our knowledge, the first blocking method with an ensured level of performance that works in massive experiments. Whereas many commonly used algorithms form pairs of units, our algorithm constructs the groups flexibly for any chosen minimum size. This facilitates complex experiments with several treatment arms and clustered data. A simulation study demonstrates the efficiency and efficacy of the algorithm; tens of millions of units can be blocked using a desktop computer in a few minutes.},

@article{Crumpetal2013,
abstract = {Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online crowdsourcing service where anonymous online workers complete web-based tasks for small sums of money. The service has attracted attention from experimental psychologists interested in gathering human subject data more efficiently. However, relative to traditional laboratory studies, many aspects of the testing environment are not under the experimenter's control. In this paper, we attempt to empirically evaluate the fidelity of the AMT system for use in cognitive behavioral experiments. These types of experiment differ from simple surveys in that they require multiple trials, sustained attention from participants, comprehension of complex instructions, and millisecond accuracy for response recording and stimulus presentation. We replicate a diverse body of tasks from experimental psychology including the Stroop, Switching, Flanker, Simon, Posner Cuing, attentional blink, subliminal priming, and category learning tasks using participants recruited using AMT. While most of replications were qualitatively successful and validated the approach of collecting data anonymously online using a web-browser, others revealed disparity between laboratory results and online results. A number of important lessons were encountered in the process of conducting these replications that should be of value to other researchers.},

abstract="Increasingly, researchers have begun to explore the potential of the Internet to reach beyond the traditional undergraduate sample. In the present study, we sought to compare the data obtained from a conventional undergraduate college-student sample to data collected via two online survey recruitment platforms. In order to examine whether the data sampled from the three populations were equivalent, we conducted a test of equivalency using inferential confidence intervals---an approach that differs from the more traditional null hypothesis significance testing. The results showed that the data obtained via the two online recruitment platforms, the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site and the virtual environment of Second Life, were statistically equivalent to the data obtained from the college sample, on the basis of means of standardized measures of psychological stress and sleep quality. Additionally, correlations between the sleep and stress measures were not statistically different between the groups. These results, along with practical considerations for the use of these recruitment platforms, are discussed, and recommendations for other researchers who may be considering the use of these platforms are provided.",

abstract="This article uses survey data obtained from Taiwan to investigate consumer perceptions of smoking risks and the linkage of these perceptions to smoking behavior. In our analysis, two equations are estimated: (1) risk perception, and (2) smoking probability. The simultaneity problem in estimating risk perception and smoking probability is also considered. Overall, the results indicate that the risk perceptions of cigarette smoking are substantially overestimated and that these risk perceptions in turn, have a significantly negative effect on smoking probability. Also, the results suggest that the determinants of risk perception are consistent with the predictions of a Bayesian learning framework.",

abstract="Previous studies of smoking risk beliefs have focused almost exclusively on risks to the smoker. Using an original set of survey data from Spain, we examine the public's perceived risks from exposures to environmental tobacco smoke. The risk categories considered included lung cancer, heart disease, life expectancy loss, and low birth weight for children of smoking mothers. Risk beliefs were quite high, often dwarfing scientific estimates of the risk. The results are consistent with overestimation of risks from highly publicized, low probability events.",
